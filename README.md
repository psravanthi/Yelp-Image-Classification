# Yelp-Image-Classification

Does your favorite Ethiopian restaurant take reservations? Will a first date at that authentic looking bistro break your wallet? Restaurant labels help Yelp users quickly answer questions like these, narrowing down their results to only restaurants that fit their nuanced needs.

I tried to answer these by labeling restaurants based on ~250,000 user uploaded images on yelp. Built a classification model using SVM and HOG for object detection to classify restaurants.

I'm working on improving the results by using convoluted neural nets.
